## NLP for Complications of Acute Ischemic Stroke

This is a central repository of Python code for Natural Language Processing (NLP) of acute ischemic stroke reports from MGB and BMC hospitals 
in order to identify critical sequelae. You will find scripts for training and testing a variety of traditional machine learning algorithms trained for this task, 
as well as code relating to the training/testing of a BERT transformer. You may also find custom approaches for rule-based systems (RBS) to respectively identify
intraventricular hemorrhage (an infrequent complicatio of acute ischemic strokes), and to quantify the degree of midline shift present within a given report.
